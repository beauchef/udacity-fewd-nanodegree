===============================

This game is the 3rd project (P3) in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.
It is loosely based on the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

# Installation

First, clone the GitHub repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/beauchef/udacity-fewd-nanodegree.git
```

# Running the game

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
The `index.html` file will be inside the `P3_arcade_game` folder.

# Playing the game

The game, in its current format, is pretty simple.
The player starts at the bottom of the screen, and needs to reach the water, at the top.
The player must avoid hitting one of the insects.

* Reaching the water will give the player 1 point
* Getting hit will remove 1 point

With every point lost or won, the player's position is reset.

The player has 60 seconds to earn as much points as he can.

There is a reset button to start the game over at any time.

# Possible improvements

In its current version, the game is very simple.
A few modifications could be made to improve the game.

* The player could choose his character
* There could be a random number of enemies
* The enemies could come from both sides, instead of simply from the left
* There could be some bonuses to collect
* Instead of a time, the player could have a finite number of lives
* There could be some simple music and sounds
* We could save the best scores
* There could be a menu

# License

Well, I did not write most of the code. So that's all I can say for now. :)
